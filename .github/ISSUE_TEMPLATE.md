<!-- This is largely modeled after the idea of [Quests](https://medium.com/@trek/source-quest-ff7d227d8fed).
The goal is to give the developer who implements this feature the proper context and
starting point so as to make it easy for anyone to get started quickly, regardless of background,
domain expertise, or familiarity with a particular part of the code. -->

## Motivation
<!--- Why is this change needed? Who will benefit from it? -->
<!--- It's often helpful (but not required) to phrase the answer thusly: -->
<!--- "As a <stakeholder>, I want to <action> so that I can <purpose achieved by action>." -->
<!--- e.g. "As a patron, I want to log in via Patreon so that I can access the -->
<!--- meditations without creating a separate account just for this app." -->

## Plan of action
<!--- If this is a meta-feature composed of several smaller features, -->
<!--- those smaller features should be listed as a checklist here, -->
<!--- and then issues should be made for those sub-features and referenced here. -->
<!--- If it is a single feature, and it has multiple required steps that you -->
<!--- already know will be required, list them here to give whoever picks up -->
<!--- the issue a head start. -->

## Criteria to close
<!--- How do you know when you're done? This should clearly define the conditions -->
<!--- that *must* be true before this issue can be closed. Being explicit about this -->
<!--- helps clearly define the scope of work and avoid scope creep. -->
