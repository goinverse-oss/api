<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->

<!--- Please make sure to create an issue for your task before creating -->
<!--- a pull pequest. (Ideally, you should create the issue before you -->
<!--- begin work, but better late than never.) This is how we keep track -->
<!--- of the discussion around planned and in-development features and also -->
<!--- how we can later find the code from the discussion and vice versa. -->

<!--- Please complete the following sections with a level of detail -->
<!--- determined at your discretion. In general, the amount of description -->
<!--- should be roughly proportional to the size and significance of the changes. -->

## Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail. Focus on the high-level "how" rather than -->
<!--- the nitty-gritty "what"; i.e. avoid repeating the diff in prose. -->

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please mention the issue here; -->
<!--- e.g. "Closes #4." This also tells GitHub to automatically -->
<!--- close the issue when the PR is merged. -->

## How Has This Been Tested?
<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->
<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->
<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->

## Screenshots (if appropriate):
<!--- Showing off your awesome work is encouraged! -->
<!--- You could also consider a quick demo via animated GIF, -->
<!--- e.g. using https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture -->
<!--- Alternatively, a picture of a cute animal is always nice. -->

<!--- NOTE: breaking changes will probably be rare until we've amassed some functionality to break. -->

## Checklist:
<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->
